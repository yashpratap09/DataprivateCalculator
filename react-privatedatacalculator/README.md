# This project is a wallet calculator project.
  it mesans store and hide private data. 

  Normally in calculators we store/hidden the data in one password ya one type But here we can store data from two types/ two password. 


  defalt password = 1111       => we can hide data 


  defalt password = 7777       => we can aslo hide data multi type it means Two type 

# basically It normally works like calculators and when we have to store/hidden data so 

enter password (1111)  so open next page for hidden data

and then same we have a also one more hidden option it means new option that a new storage for store a data

# we can also delete hidden files/data

# Here we can use a temporarily URL so after reloading URL is expired/Invalid   but we can also use ka Aws and other Url Generator.



# // here we use a react and HTML and CSS and also use a Bootstrap.







# Normally calculators Me hum Ek password se data ko hide kar sakte Hai but esme hm 2 alag alag jagah par data ko store/hide kar sakte Hai.

Yaha par hum temporarily URL generator ka use kr rahe hai to reloading ke baad URL Expired/invalid ho jata hai . to eske liye hm yaha pr AWS and or bhi Permanent URL generator ka use kr skte hai .


and password ko change bhi kr skte hai.
