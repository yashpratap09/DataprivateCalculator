# This project is a wallet calculator project.
  it mesans store and hide private data. 

  Normally in calculators we store/hidden the data in one password ya one type But here we can store data from two types/ two password. 


  defalt password = 1111       => we can hide data 


  defalt password = 2222       => we can aslo hide data multi type it means Two type 

# basically It normally works like calculators and when we have to store/hidden data so 

enter password (1111)  so open next page for hidden data

and then same we have a also one more hidden option it means new option that a new storage for store a data


it this project i not use a any datastorage but we also connect a backend and store data in any data base. but here i not use any storage.



# // here we use a react and HTML and CSS and also use a Bootstrap.
